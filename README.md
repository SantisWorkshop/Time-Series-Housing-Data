# Time-Series-Housing-Data

This repository contains a work in progress time-series analysis on housing data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales). Using R, we seperate the data into bedrooms and housing type to forecast prices for housing units. Once we have seperated our data we create our time-series objects and run ARIMA to aid us in forcasting out values.
