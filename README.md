# Time-Series-Housing-Data

This repository contains a work in progress time-series analysis on housing data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales). The `ma_lga_12345.csv` contains the data from the link. Using R, we seperate the data into bedrooms and housing type to forecast prices for housing units. Once we have seperated our data we create our time-series objects and run ARIMA to aid us in forcasting out values.
